A [DataView|http://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/site/apidocs/uk/org/ponder/rsf/view/DataView.html] is the direct way to return non-markup responses from RSF - this is primarily used for JSON payloads, but can also be used for any other form of custom response, such as images, PDF documents, Excel spreadsheets, etc.

A DataView is in outline extremely similar to a standard [ViewProducer|ComponentProducer], only the return type, rather than being a component tree, is a plain {{Object}} which is interpreted by the system in a number of ways. 

!!A simple JSON DataView

To create a simple DataView returning JSON, implement the {{DataView}} interface to determine the JSON content type, return the [viewID] for the view, and then finally implement the {{getData}} method to return the object you want encoded.

Note that, just like a [ViewProducer|ComponentProducers], a DataView may also implement [ViewParamsReporter|http://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/site/apidocs/uk/org/ponder/rsf/viewstate/ViewParamsReporter.html] in order to determine a more detailed class of [ViewParameters] which is uses to represent its view state (URL) information.

{{{
public class JSONCatalogView implements DataView {
  public static final String VIEW_ID = &quot;catalog&quot;;
  
  public String getViewID() {
    return VIEW_ID;
  }
  
  private CatalogService catalogService;
  
  public void setCatalogService(CatalogService catalogService) {
    this.catalogService = catalogService;
  }

  public String getContentType() {
    return ContentTypeInfoRegistry.JSON;
  }

  public Object getData(ViewParameters viewparams) {
    return catalogService.getSalesItems();
  }
  
}
}}}

Here we show a simple bean which has one dependency, a {{CatalogService}} from which we can fetch the data we want encoded. This is a sample DataView from the [RSFAjaxJSON] sample application which you can check out of [SVN here|https://source.caret.cam.ac.uk/rsf/projects/RSFSamples/trunk/AjaxJSON]. In this case, the return type of CatalogService is as from

{{{
public interface CatalogService {
	public SalesItem[] getSalesItems();
	public void setSalesItems(SalesItem[] items);
}
}}}

Essentially any Java object type is acceptable as ready to be encoded to JSON - as well as standard POJOs, the standard framework encoder will accept Lists, Maps and arrays of POJOs also.

!! Other content types

As of RSF 0.7.3, DataViews are also the preferred way of returning most other non-markup responses. By returning the name of some other content type from the {{getContentType}} method, you can return data representing content of any other type --- the builtin framework content types are listed in [ContentTypeInfoRegistry|https://source.caret.cam.ac.uk/rsf/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/src/uk/org/ponder/rsf/content/ContentTypeInfoRegistry.java]. If your content type is not listed there, instead return {{ContentTypeInfoRegistry.CUSTOM}} from {{getContentType}}, and you can then inject the {{HttpServletResponse}} object directly (available under the standard bean name {{httpServletResponseProxy}} and send any custom headers yourself.

!!! Sending the data

Practically any sensible form is appropriate for returning your data. RSF will accept either an {{InputStream}}, a {{Reader}}, a raw array of bytes, or a {{String}}, and appropriately relay these to the output stream in the environment. Note that character data will be encoded as {{UTF-8}}.

!!Accepting Input

To create a view capable of receiving input, say, in the form of JSON, additionally implement [DataInputHandler|http://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/site/apidocs/uk/org/ponder/rsf/view/DataInputHandler.html] which allows you to determine a range of supported HTTP methods (typically POST, PUT) for accepting data. For example, here is the {{JSONCatalogView}} seen above, with additional methods for accepting input (the {{DataView}} methods have been skipped here):

{{{
public class JSONCatalogView implements DataView, DataInputHandler, TypeDecodable {

.....

  public String getHandledMethods() {
    return &quot;post, put&quot;;
  }

  public void handleInput(ViewParameters viewparams, String method, Object data) {
    catalogService.setSalesItems((SalesItem[]) data);
  }

  public Object getDecodeTarget() {
    return new SalesItem[] {};
  }
  
}
}}}

{{getHandledMethods}} returns a comma-separated list of supported HTTP methods, and the {{handleInput}} method is called to actually accept the data. You will probably want to implement also the [TypeDecodable] interface to instruct the framework what kind of Java object you want the (JSON) data to be decoded into - this method returns an &quot;exemplar&quot; of the appropriate type. If you do not do this, you will receive the raw InputStream to perform the decoding yourself.
