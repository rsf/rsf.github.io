A continuation, broadly speaking, is a kind of &quot;partially executed&quot; flow, complete with its scope environment, that has been suspended during execution. This is a powerful concept that can &quot;gear&quot; the world of forwards-driven, declarative flow or logic design, and the &quot;backwards-driven&quot;, request-oriented nature of the web. Continuations are not directly supported by RSF, but are available as part of its integration with [Spring Web Flow]. [Language-level continuations|RIFEContinuations] are available as part of the [RIFE] continuations project.
