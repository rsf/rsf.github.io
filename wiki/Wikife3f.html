[TokenStateHolder|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/src/uk/org/ponder/rsf/state/TokenStateHolder.java] is the central interface in RSF defining communication with sources of state outside the request scope, of which the classic example is Session state of various kinds (HTTP Servlet, Portlet, Sakai etc.). This interface is very close to that of a primitive Map or [BeanLocator], and is named differently simply to clarify the semantics. More discussion is on the [ScopedBeans] page.
