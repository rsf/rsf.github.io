!!! Email lists

There are 2 [email lists|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list] for [RSF]. One publically joinable list for anyone using RSF and one for the RSF development team.

!! RSF users list

This list is joinable by anyone and can be used to ask questions about RSF (though in general we encourage using the [forums|http://ponder.org.uk/rsf/] for this). It will be used to announce new versions of RSF and things that are of interest to anyone using RSF.

!! RSF developers list

This list requires approval to join (this is to reduce the traffic to relevant topics). It is used by the RSF development team and contributors to discuss architecture changes, releases, and the like. Questions about using RSF should not be posted to this list.\\
__NOTE:__ We are happy to allow people to join this list with &quot;read only&quot; status if they are interested in listening in on our discussions, just note this in an email to the list (you can also view the archives any time you like)
