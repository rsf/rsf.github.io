In RSF, the class [View] is used as the holder of the [component tree|ComponentTree] specifying the abstract properties of the view to be rendered and the behaviour of its components, independent from the rendering technology to be used. In an [MVC|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller] architecture, the component tree would constitute the controller layer. In the light of this, some might consider this name somewhat deceptive (!), but since in RSF the specification of the view itself is beyond the reach of code, the View is the closest thing to a view there is.
