Named for the sequence of keystrokes in [Eclipse|http://www.eclipse.org/] that automatically brings up the &quot;Quick Fix&quot; dialog when the cursor centred on a compile error. Simply hitting &quot;return&quot; at this point will in most cases automatically resolve it.

Over time, I find myself using this facility more and more when I know that there is a quick fix that will express my [intention], graduating from not typing casts and try.. catch blocks to not even adding fields to my classes but simply trying to assign to them. Even ''with'' the Eclipse &quot;encapsulate field access&quot; fix, I still find creating getters and setters tedious which is one reason I am very fond of [Peas].

I'm sure this is just a small taste of what is to come - freed from the drudgery of writing casts, import statments, exception blocks, method stubs for interfaces, and able to move methods and fields from class to class, package to package and even project to project at will, it is much easier to concentrate on the actual business of programming.

CTRL-1 programming is also related to another programming discipline I am fond of (although one with few adherents in the theory-based community) of &quot;error-based programming&quot;. Managing errors in Eclipse is such a streamlined process that it is sometimes useful simply to induce them to see what breaks where. One small-scale example of this is making a member variable or method into a static in order to VERY quickly get an overview of what depends on it, perhaps as a prelude to (re)moving it. A larger-scale example was the creation of RSFUtil from its predecessor JSFUtil by removing all the JSF jars...
