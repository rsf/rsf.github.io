Each heading that you use generates also a &quot;named anchor&quot; into the HTML file.  This allows you to refer to a section of a wiki page.

For example, if the heading on this page is called
{{{
!!This is my heading
}}}
The resulting HTML code would look like
{{{
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;section-NamedHeadings-ThisIsMyHeading&quot;&gt;This is my heading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
}}}

This allows you to refer to the heading from a different wiki page.  And you can use it from WikiMarkup as well!  For example, saying [TextFormattingRules#PreformattedText] (which looks like this in WikiMarkup: {{{[{TextFormattingRules#PreformattedText]}}}) refers to the &quot;Preformatted text&quot; -section of the page [TextFormattingRules].  If you are too lazy to figure out what the link name is, you can also just type the heading as-is:  [Text formatting rules#Preformatted text].

Note that this does not work with [CamelCase] links.
