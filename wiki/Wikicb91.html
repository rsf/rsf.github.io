WikiNames are traditionally written using InterCapping, so that making hyperlinks is really easy.

However, in this [WikiWiki] the links are written only using the [[link] notation, as the original InterCapping style of linking is, IMHO, slightly confusing.  The names still conform to the [WikiWiki] standard, if you look at the URL at the top.

Names are ''crushed'', i.e. [[This is a link] becomes [[ThisIsALink].  However,
underscores and dots are retained, so you can have a link like this: [[This_is_a_link], or [[This.Is.A.Link].
