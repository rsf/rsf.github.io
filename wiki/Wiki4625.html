!Usage

{{{
&lt;wiki:UserCheck status=&quot;unknown|known|named|validated|unvalidated&quot;&gt;
   JSP or HTML content
&lt;/wiki:UserCheck&gt;
}}}

!Parameters

;__status__: Is used to determine if the user has logged in or what.  See below.

The possible values of &quot;status&quot; are:

* &quot;unknown&quot;     - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is completely unknown (no cookie, no password)
* &quot;known&quot;       - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is not unknown (i.e has a cookie, 
                  or has been authenticated.
* &quot;named&quot;       - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user has either been named by a cookie, but
                  not been authenticated.
* &quot;validated&quot;   - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is validated either through the container,
                  or by our own authentication.
* &quot;unvalidated&quot; - the body of the tag is included 
                  if the user is not validated (i.e. he could have a cookie,
                  but has not been authenticated.)

In 2.0 there was an attribute called &quot;exists&quot;.  This is now deprecated, but it is still recognized.  See below.

!Example
{{{
    &lt;wiki:UserCheck status=&quot;known&quot;&gt;
        G'day,&lt;wiki:UserName /&gt;
    &lt;/wiki:UserCheck&gt;

    &lt;wiki:UserCheck status=&quot;unknown&quot;&gt;
        Set your name in &lt;wiki:LinkTo page=&quot;UserPreferences&quot;&gt;UserPreferences&lt;/wiki:LinkTo&gt;
    &lt;/wiki:UserCheck&gt;
}}}

Displays a greeting, if the user has either set a cookie or logged in; else displays a link to the page UserPreferences.

!Notes

The behavior of this tag was significantly enhanced in 2.2.  The old tag had the parameter &quot;exists&quot;, which corresponds to the status parameter as follows:

__OLD__
{{{
&lt;wiki:UserCheck exists=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
}}}
Replace with
{{{
&lt;wiki:UserCheck status=&quot;known&quot;&gt;
}}}

__OLD__
{{{
&lt;wiki:UserCheck exists=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
}}}
Replace with
{{{
&lt;wiki:UserCheck status=&quot;unknown&quot;&gt;
}}}
