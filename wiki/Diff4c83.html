<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">only of) the &quot;ClassViewHandler&quot; and &quot;TemplateHandler&quot; from Chapter 15.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">The changes that I made, roughly in order, were as follows (as you </td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">natural semantics):</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">i) refusing to restore the component tree from restoreView in the</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">case of a GET. This was part of my very initial perception that JSF's</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">component tree was extremely wasteful in server resources, or else</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">in client state. Since I was going to the trouble of regenerating</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the entire component tree in any case it seemed highly absurd for</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the framework to have been trying to cache it somewhere. In addition</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">given this was a highly dynamic application it is quite likely that</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the model had asynchronously changed in the meantime. This was very</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">much a &quot;token&quot; measure since at this time I had no way of servicing</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">a POST without access to the component tree, but I think marked out</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">symbolically the direction I thought JSF had to go in. A core point</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">of RSF is now that the component tree is destroyed at the end of</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">EVERY request cycle and stored nowhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">If you were to ask for a succinct summary of the reasons I thought</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">JSF ought be abandoned, it would be &quot;Heavyweight components, in</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">part of a web framework&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">ii) instituting strict POST-&gt;GET redirect for all requests. This is</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">as far as I can see a completely fundamental requirement for webapps</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">which satisfying the browser idiom, which in my view should be all of</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">them, given they all end up being viewed by browsers. A difficulty</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">created here was managing to transfer FacesMessages from one cycle</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">to the next (see below). No rendering is performed on POST cycles</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">as is correct for portlet as well as general HTTP. I expect this</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">problem is one of those solved in JSF 1.2.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">iii) instituting the &quot;ViewParameters&quot; system. Probably the #2 </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">deficit of JSF is that it has no idiomatic system for accessing</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">URL state. This has in fact proved completely fatal in a large</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">project that I am working with (Sakai) in that all the framework</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">developers eventually lost faith in URL state and other than the</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">viewID, came to rely on random stuff stored in the session. The</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">result is that the project's portal has essentially architecturally</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">collapsed in that REST idioms are impossible and the back button</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">cannot be made to work. Obviously this is not a forced consequence</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">of working with JSF, but JSF's lack of respect for the natural</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">idiom of HTTP being that state, primarily, is URL state exacerbated </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the problem enormously. ViewParameters does the work of representing</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the URL state in a HTTP-neutral way by mapping parts of the URL into</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">fields of a user-defined near-POJO. Actually since ViewParameters is</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">pretty much the oldest part of RSF it is now actually the most</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">deficient (although this is actually still not a completely easy</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">problem to solve conceptually). It is due for an overhaul in RSF 0.8.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">iv) The introduction of the &quot;fast EL&quot; system for bindings. These</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">were a set of hidden fields rendered into forms that were guaranteed</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">to be processed *first* before JSF's &quot;apply request values&quot; phase,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">that would properly contextualise the bean model. These bindings</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">encoded primitive operations on the request bean model. This was the </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">beginnings of RSF's &quot;request-scope IoC&quot; system in which </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">request-scope entities could participate in first-class IoC by</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">means of &quot;assignments&quot; (in Spring-speak, &quot;wirings&quot;) performed as</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">a kind of context startup. This became clear when reading your </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">chapter on the &quot;ReportHandler&quot; app, primarily in chapter 10. </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">I constantly asked myself the question... &quot;how does the </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">ReportHandler know which report it is to work on&quot;? In your </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">non-persistent example this was clear - there was just one </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">Report in request scope, and this is the common pattern I have</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">seen in JSP-type apps since the beginning of time. But say this</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">Report had a persistent identity, how on earth would we come</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">to find it? In JSF, the only answer would be to scrawl a note</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">in the session scope - pretty unacceptable. Even that done, there</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">would be the matter of communicating this to the persistence system</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">in some kind of idiomatic way, which is leading even the Spring</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">people to measures such as injecting DAOs into &quot;entities&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">signalled by annotations &amp;c. With the &quot;fast EL&quot; system, which</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">gradually evolved into RSF's bindings system and RSAC, this is</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">completely idiomatic - every entity has its unique EL path, and</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">these are set up to be &quot;wired&quot; by bindings before the subsequent</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">request starts up.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">v) JSF components are so behaviourful that a constant requirement</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">was to generate references from one component to another. In </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">particular, without access to the &quot;clientId&quot; of a component it is </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">impossible to prepare for any client-side work - this was also </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">essential for the FacesMessage propagation work for ii). </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">Unfortunately the code to compute this ID is buried in the </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">monstrosity of the UIComponent hierarchy, so the only way to get </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">at it was to institute the &quot;EarlyFacesContext&quot; - this delegated </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">to the existing FacesContext in all cases except for getViewRoot() </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">which was initialised with the correct root &quot;early&quot;, the moment</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the component tree started to be constructed. This forced</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">With these 5 major heads of changes (along with a host of other </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">details to make things work) we get to the state of &quot;JSFUtil&quot; as</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">it was in July of last year. This operated a kind of &quot;shell&quot; of JSF</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">that was being used principally for rendering and the basic sequence</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">of the request cycle, with most of the logic routed out due to the</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">preferably without recompilation or developer effort.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">At this point the idea for the IKAT renderer, which I had been</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">kicking around my head, initially inspired by your &quot;HTMLTemplateHandler&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">HTMLTemplateHandler (as indeed you could in some way say Facelets is),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">only with the crucial capability of *alternation* between</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">template-driven scanning and component-driven scanning. This last</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">is the key capability which lets things like tables and trees be</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">induce replication in the structure of the template in a particular</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">domain, but then to *return* to the static template structure</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">once the replication/branching is complete. There are other</td></tr>

<tr><td class="diffadd">thinking on &quot;locally controlled&quot; systems based on IoC. For</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">example, it is quite easy for a &quot;rogue&quot; piece of JSF logic to hijack</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">the entire request processing by simply poking globally visible</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">methods of FacesContext. The validation phase is particularly </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">tightly coupled, I recall, both being hard to disable, and also </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">quite liable to cause other phases to be skipped on its own</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">initiative. Local code with global effects is a standing hazard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">Another difficulty with the Phase system is that it makes it</td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">very hard to write &quot;reliable&quot; logic, especially viz. cleanup - </td></tr>
<tr><td class="diffadd">in general no execution in Java can be relied upon other than</td></tr>
