<pre>
[WikiForms] are opened with a [FormOpen] -statement.

!Parameters

You MUST specify the following:

* __form__: Each form must have a name.  For example &quot;myBugReportForm&quot;.

You may also specify any of the following parameters:

* __submit__: The URL (relative or absolute) of a servlet that is capable of handling the request from this [WikiForm].  If not set, it will submit it back to the same page the form is on.
* __method__: Controls how the form is posted: it can either be &quot;get&quot; or &quot;post&quot;.  If this parameter is missing, the default is to use &quot;post&quot;.
* __hide__: Controls the visibility of the form.  If set to &quot;onsuccess&quot;, the form is hidden when the form has been submitted successfully.  Default is to keep the form visible all the time.

!Example

{{{
[{FormOpen form='bugreportform' hide='onsuccess' method='post' submit='/servlets/bugreportsubmitservlet/'}]
}}}
