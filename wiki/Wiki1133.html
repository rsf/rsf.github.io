An URL Constructor is a JSPWiki plugin which can be used to control how the different URLs that JSPWiki generates should look like.

!Choosing your URLConstructor

JSPWiki includes three basic URLConstructors for managing link generation:

* [DefaultURLConstructor] - which you're probably using right now.
* [ShortViewURLConstructor] - replaces &quot;Wiki.jsp&quot; with the ~WikiServlet.
* [ShortURLConstructor] - replaces all JSP pages with the ~WikiServlet.

!Using a URLConstructor

Edit your jspwiki.properties file, and add the following line:
{{{
jspwiki.urlConstructor = &lt;constructor name&gt;
}}}

For example:
{{{
jspwiki.baseURL = http://example.com:8080/testwiki/
jspwiki.urlConstructor = ShortURLConstructor
}}}

would use the ShortURLConstructor. All relative URLs would look like &quot;/testwiki/wiki/Foobar&quot; and all absolute URLs would look like &quot;http://example.com:8080/testwiki/wiki/Foobar&quot;.
