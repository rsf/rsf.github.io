BeanLocator is the core RSF interface which &quot;locates&quot; a bean in its immediate container (given a single path component):

{{{
public interface BeanLocator {
  public Object locateBean(String path);
}

}}}

Any bean found implementing BeanLocator (or indeed java.util.Map) will be navigable via RSF [EL] to the next path component by means of the locateBean (or get()) method, in addition to support for Java beans style paths mapping to properties via introspection (and of course [Peas]). 

Other pages relevant to BeanLocator are [OLI] for a tour of RSF's One Line Interfaces, and [OTP] for the use of BeanLocator in the wider context of RSF's ORM idiom.
