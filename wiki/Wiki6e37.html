!! Working with the RSF sample applications

! [Building webapps using maven]

[{InsertPage page='BuildingWebappsUsingMaven' style='padding-left:1em;'}]

! Verbose logging
You may wish to edit the {{log4j.properties}} file held in {{src/webapp/WEB-INF/classes}} of the various sample apps, and set the following line {{log4j.logger.PonderUtilCore=info}} to the {{warn}} level. However, RSF is not yet at full release status and the verbose logs can sometimes be helpful.
