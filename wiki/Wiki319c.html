The resolution set for an [IKAT Function Call|IKATFunctionCall] is a set of tags appearing in a group of template files which all share the same prefix. These all peer with [containers|Container] in the [view tree|ComponentTree], and are all candidates for being the &quot;best&quot; instance of a (UI) component which which to render the container (and its children) which the [IKAT] algorithm currently has in its hands. On choosing a member of the resolution set, IKAT will &quot;branch&quot; to this template location, and push the old template position on its stack.
