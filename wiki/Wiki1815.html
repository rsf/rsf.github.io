</p><h2 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFROMJSFSEQUENCEJSFUTIL">RSF FROM JSF - SEQUENCE (JSFUTIL)<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFROMJSFSEQUENCEJSFUTIL">#</a></h2>
<p />
<p>In the beginning there was i) FlowTalk (intended to
be a highly configurable &quot;discussions with workflow&quot; webapp, and ii)
your book. 
</p>
<p>The library &quot;JSFUtil&quot; I created was based around (initially consisting
only of) the &quot;ClassViewHandler&quot; and &quot;TemplateHandler&quot; from Chapter 15.
The changes that I made, roughly in order, were as follows (as you 
go down the list these involve an increasing violation of JSF's 
natural semantics):
</p>
<p>i) refusing to restore the component tree from restoreView in the
case of a GET. This was part of my very initial perception that JSF's
component tree was extremely wasteful in server resources, or else
in client state. Since I was going to the trouble of regenerating
the entire component tree in any case it seemed highly absurd for
the framework to have been trying to cache it somewhere. In addition
given this was a highly dynamic application it is quite likely that
the model had asynchronously changed in the meantime. This was very
much a &quot;token&quot; measure since at this time I had no way of servicing
a POST without access to the component tree, but I think marked out
symbolically the direction I thought JSF had to go in. A core point
of RSF is now that the component tree is destroyed at the end of
EVERY request cycle and stored nowhere.
</p>
<p>If you were to ask for a succinct summary of the reasons I thought
JSF ought be abandoned, it would be &quot;Heavyweight components, in
particular ones that must be persisted, must not be a necessary
part of a web framework&quot;.
</p>
<p>ii) instituting strict POST-&gt;GET redirect for all requests. This is
as far as I can see a completely fundamental requirement for webapps
which satisfying the browser idiom, which in my view should be all of
them, given they all end up being viewed by browsers. A difficulty
created here was managing to transfer FacesMessages from one cycle
to the next (see below). No rendering is performed on POST cycles
as is correct for portlet as well as general HTTP. I expect this
problem is one of those solved in JSF 1.2.
</p>
<p>iii) instituting the &quot;ViewParameters&quot; system. Probably the #2 
deficit of JSF is that it has no idiomatic system for accessing
URL state. This has in fact proved completely fatal in a large
project that I am working with (Sakai) in that all the framework
developers eventually lost faith in URL state and other than the
viewID, came to rely on random stuff stored in the session. The
result is that the project's portal has essentially architecturally
collapsed in that REST idioms are impossible and the back button
cannot be made to work. Obviously this is not a forced consequence
of working with JSF, but JSF's lack of respect for the natural
idiom of HTTP being that state, primarily, is URL state exacerbated 
the problem enormously. ViewParameters does the work of representing
the URL state in a HTTP-neutral way by mapping parts of the URL into
fields of a user-defined near-POJO. Actually since ViewParameters is
pretty much the oldest part of RSF it is now actually the most
deficient (although this is actually still not a completely easy
problem to solve conceptually). It is due for an overhaul in RSF 0.8.
</p>
<p>iv) The introduction of the &quot;fast EL&quot; system for bindings. These
were a set of hidden fields rendered into forms that were guaranteed
to be processed *first* before JSF's &quot;apply request values&quot; phase,
that would properly contextualise the bean model. These bindings
encoded primitive operations on the request bean model. This was the 
beginnings of RSF's &quot;request-scope IoC&quot; system in which 
request-scope entities could participate in first-class IoC by
means of &quot;assignments&quot; (in Spring-speak, &quot;wirings&quot;) performed as
a kind of context startup. This became clear when reading your 
chapter on the &quot;ReportHandler&quot; app, primarily in chapter 10. 
I constantly asked myself the question... &quot;how does the 
ReportHandler know which report it is to work on&quot;? In your 
non-persistent example this was clear - there was just one 
Report in request scope, and this is the common pattern I have
seen in JSP-type apps since the beginning of time. But say this
Report had a persistent identity, how on earth would we come
to find it? In JSF, the only answer would be to scrawl a note
in the session scope - pretty unacceptable. Even that done, there
would be the matter of communicating this to the persistence system
in some kind of idiomatic way, which is leading even the Spring
people to measures such as injecting DAOs into &quot;entities&quot;
signalled by annotations &amp;c. With the &quot;fast EL&quot; system, which
gradually evolved into RSF's bindings system and RSAC, this is
completely idiomatic - every entity has its unique EL path, and
these are set up to be &quot;wired&quot; by bindings before the subsequent
request starts up.
</p>
<p>v) JSF components are so behaviourful that a constant requirement
was to generate references from one component to another. In 
particular, without access to the &quot;clientId&quot; of a component it is 
impossible to prepare for any client-side work - this was also 
essential for the FacesMessage propagation work for ii). 
Unfortunately the code to compute this ID is buried in the 
monstrosity of the UIComponent hierarchy, so the only way to get 
at it was to institute the &quot;EarlyFacesContext&quot; - this delegated 
to the existing FacesContext in all cases except for getViewRoot() 
which was initialised with the correct root &quot;early&quot;, the moment
the component tree started to be constructed. This forced
&quot;top-down&quot; construction of component trees has continued in RSF - 
given JSF seems to be designed from the view that the component
tree *could* have been constructed in any order, it seems there
was no provision for working out clientIds until the construction
had finished.
</p>
<p>I could go on about JSF's other architectural deficiencies (firstly
the existence of FacesContext, and secondly the global access to it
which is the most utter destroyer of testability, thirdly
the crazy table rendering model, fourthly the fragile and
untrustable PhaseListener system, fifthly the lack of any coherent
policy wrt. exceptions &amp;c), at some length,
but I will move on :P
</p>
<h2 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFROMJSFSEQUENCERSFUTIL">RSF FROM JSF - SEQUENCE (RSFUTIL)<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFROMJSFSEQUENCERSFUTIL">#</a></h2>
<p />
<p>With these 5 major heads of changes (along with a host of other 
details to make things work) we get to the state of &quot;JSFUtil&quot; as
it was in July of last year. This operated a kind of &quot;shell&quot; of JSF
that was being used principally for rendering and the basic sequence
of the request cycle, with most of the logic routed out due to the
custom ViewHandler. At this point I was presented with an 
essentially intractible reskinning requirement - we were required
to make the *same app* render fundamentally reorganised (i.e. in
HTML order, not just in CSS) versions of the same user interface,
preferably without recompilation or developer effort.
</p>
<p>At this point the idea for the IKAT renderer, which I had been
kicking around my head, initially inspired by your &quot;HTMLTemplateHandler&quot;
came to the fore. IKAT is actually just a generalisation of 
HTMLTemplateHandler (as indeed you could in some way say Facelets is),
only with the crucial capability of *alternation* between
template-driven scanning and component-driven scanning. This last
is the key capability which lets things like tables and trees be
rendered in RSF so straightforwardly, since it allows RSF to 
induce replication in the structure of the template in a particular
domain, but then to *return* to the static template structure
once the replication/branching is complete. There are other
important differences in philosophy which I could talk about if
you're interested.
</p>
<p>Given at this point I was using JSF largely for rendering, there
seemed little point in maintaining the JSF component structure at
all, given I fundamentally disagreed with its idiom where the
incoming request values were applied *first* to the components
during &quot;applyRequestValues&quot; and only THEN to &quot;UpdateModelValues&quot;,
and was intending to apply my own rendering. So this was the signal
to kick over the rest of the structure, which could loosely be
described as &quot;renaming JSF to RSF and trying to get the code to
compile again&quot; :P In particular the key action was the creation of
RSF's component hierarchy which became semi-ironically named  
after JSF's. The core contrast here is that RSF's &quot;UIComponent&quot;
is 61 lines, which are mostly comments, with just one method - 
compared to JSF's UIComponent+UIComponentBase which is an intricate
tangle summing to a grand 2900 lines. I have to say that this is the
key answer to your question as to whether I though I might not have
made &quot;better inroads&quot; building my framework on JSF - the key point
is that RSF was primarily derived by starting with JSF and taking
things *out* - had I built on JSF as so many are now unwisely
doing, it simply couldn't have ever become the right framework,
even had it perhaps initially enjoyed more popularity. As far as
I can see, Facelets is roughly would have been had I built RSF
on JSF, but it can only reform the rendering system (which I don't
think is done as neatly as RSF). Given I had already replaced
most of JSF *except* for the rendering system by the time I came
to write IKAT, logically there was pretty much nothing that should
remain.

<p />
<p>That said, I think I should summarise the &quot;diamonds&quot; that I managed
to rescue from JSF, since it did indeed contain many ideas that
were both new and highly valuable. In these terms JSF actually &quot;is&quot;
the best framework out there in terms of ideas, since I don't think
any other framework has innovated in quite so many ways at once - 
the tragedy is that these great ideas were practically negated
by being wired together in a close relationship with so many poor
or &quot;unreformed&quot; ideas, and often poor execution.
</p>
<h3 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-JSFKeyValuePoints">JSF key value points:<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-JSFKeyValuePoints">#</a></h3>
<p>i) Introduction of the idea of an &quot;abstract&quot; component tree 
insulating framework users from the target idiom (HTML, WAP, XUL, 
whatever)<br />
ii) Increased cementing of the idea begun in JSPs of a pure
&quot;bean&quot; model, potentially defined framework-free by developers which
is poked by abstract &quot;EL&quot; paths.<br />
iii) The use of &quot;bindings&quot; attached to components which 
represented an association of UI values to model values.<br />
iv) The idea of an &quot;action&quot; binding which invoked an abstract
application-defined action with a String result, which was then
interpreted by a layer of indirection.<br />
v) Beginning to become &quot;portal-ready&quot; by separating Action
URLs from Resource URLs &amp;c.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-JSFKeyErrors">JSF key errors:<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-JSFKeyErrors">#</a></h2>
<p>i) Continuing use of a &quot;fat&quot; component hierarchy. Not only fat
in terms of size (2900 lines for a base class is simply beyond
a joke in terms of poor design) but fat in behaviour. Actually
90% of JSF's badness lies in its components - they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) consume state and developer resources in being looked after<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) provide strong framework coupling that is almost ineradicable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;c) constrain developer's idioms in enforcing particular models
of UI interaction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d) obstruct cooperation with ORM solutions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;e) lack of natural integration with IoC (JSF-Spring obviously
helped with this at the developer end, but this is actually
even more critical for the *framework* - providing a set of
5 interfaces that could be overridden in faces-config just doesn't
cut it<br />
ii) Lack of access by view producers of a (portable) representation
of URL state<br />
iii) Lack of natural cooperation with client-side logic and HTML
idioms. JSF form rendering is obnoxious and the unpredictable nature
of the assigned ids pretty much rules out any kind of productive
interaction with client-side logic.<br />
(see above for 5 more key JSF problems)
</p>
<p>Naturally since it was me who drew up these lists, all the key
&quot;value points&quot; are preserved in RSF, and all the &quot;errors&quot; are 
removed... 
</p>
<p>I've surely gone on for far longer than you have patience for, but
hopefully I've conveyed enough of my reasoning into why I think
JSF is beyond salvaging in terms of constructing a good framework
by building on it. 
</p>
<h2 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFUTUREHEAVYWEIGHTS">RSF FUTURE (HEAVYWEIGHTS)<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-RSFFUTUREHEAVYWEIGHTS">#</a></h2>
<p />
<p>An important point that I hope I put across on the ServerSide
thread is that by designing RSF's &quot;lightweight&quot; components I have
not in any way closed the door to somesequent &quot;heavyweight&quot; 
framework being built on them (perhaps a kind of JSF-on-RSF,
or Wicket-on-RSF), although given the constraints offered by RSF's
bindings and encoding system, this heavyweight framework would
probably not develop quite in the same way as JSF or Wicket. 
</p>
<p>One idea I am however kicking around is that essentially *all*
view logic (of the sort expressed in heavyweight components)
is actually completely unnecessary! Already in RSF I am not 
feeling particular pain due to not having stable &quot;view domain
objects&quot; whose job it is to manage bits of the view, and the
only danger I can see coming down the line is this whole nasty
business of &quot;listeners&quot; and &quot;events&quot; to which most of the bulk
in H-C systems is devoted (cf JSF's and Wicket's &quot;Component&quot; 
base class). I have an idea that UI event propagation might
in fact be done in a kind of &quot;declarative&quot; way much in the same
way that Spring demarcates transations. A key part of this would
be a kind of &quot;Bean Invalidation Model&quot; (BIM) which summarises the
network of *model side-effects* that are expected to be
represented in the view as a result of writes issued to EL 
paths. Some parts of the model could also just be declared
&quot;volatile&quot;. Event propagation as a result of user actions would 
then just be performed by framework code. Asynchronous propagation
might be achieved just by timers, or perhaps by some form of 
AOP proxying. 
</p>
<h2 id="section-JSFandRSFHistory-XMLANDOTHERTEXT">XML AND OTHER TEXT<a class="hashlink" href="#section-JSFandRSFHistory-XMLANDOTHERTEXT">#</a></h2>
<p />
<p>To answer your question proper as regards XML stuff, at least in 
the area of Spring configuration, I think what will help here is
the tool chain. I went on at length about Spring IDE in the TSS
thread, but I should say again that Spring IDE was a key 
consideration in going with Spring for RSF as well as RSAC, in that
now app-scope and request-scope containers can all be validated and
refactored with a single tool. 
</p>
<p>Lots can be done through &quot;convention&quot; as you say - in my Hibernate
app for example I try to exploit the fact that an entity will be
mapped under a name that agrees with its classname (in Hibernate
2.x this happens by default anyway) which helps in constructing
the bindings. I think the key problem in Java in this respect
is that while may is possible for *beans* it is not possible
for *methods* - given Java lacks the equivalent of C++'s 
&quot;pointer to member function&quot; or &quot;pointer to member data&quot; constructs,
there is simply no way to programmatically generate a reference to
a bean's property in a way the compiler could check. 
</p>
<p>This does point decisively back to the &quot;tools&quot; answer. I think
in general this is fuller answer than the &quot;convention&quot; answer 
which does if taken to extremes force a sort of &quot;wizard&quot; mentality
on developers (lots of discussion on this on the &quot;will Ruby displace
Java&quot; thread on TSS). Like humans, I think Java has survived
primarily through its increasingly excellent tools, rather than 
through being adapted to any particular purpose :P RoR may be
marvellous at cranking out &quot;CRUD&quot; type apps but take it even slightly
out of its domain and it quickly becomes a nonsensical, fragile and
frustrating environment. On the other hand Java (and more strongly
XML) are sometimes annoyingly verbose (especially if you are using
a bad framework :) but by their general regularity and widespread
nature are increasingly becoming amenable to some quite marvellous
tools - Eclipse, IoC containers such as Spring, CGLIB, various kinds
of AOP are just a smattering - and now we are seeing the 
&quot;2nd-generation&quot; of meta- or fusion tools such as Spring IDE which is
gradually becoming quite slick.

<p>I do have to say that I would have dearly loved to have been
able to preserve JSF as you advise - and struggled for nearly 9 months
to do so if at all possible, given the very obvious practical and 
commercial benefits that this would have had.
</p>
<p>But unfortunately I came to consider even the two core JSF inviolables
that you mention, the JSF lifecycle and the component &quot;API&quot; to be in
error - Firstly, the form of definition of the JSF lifecycle, based
on the &quot;Phase&quot; system is brittle and out-of-keeping with modern 
thinking on &quot;locally controlled&quot; systems based on IoC. For
example, it is quite easy for a &quot;rogue&quot; piece of JSF logic to hijack
the entire request processing by simply poking globally visible
methods of FacesContext. The validation phase is particularly 
tightly coupled, I recall, both being hard to disable, and also 
quite liable to cause other phases to be skipped on its own
initiative. Local code with global effects is a standing hazard.
</p>
<p>Another difficulty with the Phase system is that it makes it
very hard to write &quot;reliable&quot; logic, especially viz. cleanup - 
in general no execution in Java can be relied upon other than
a clearly visible try {} finally {} pair within the same stack
frame, which is a situation impossible to arrange surrounding Phase
logic - it is quite possible for Phase events and notifications to
go astray in the event of unexpected failures and exceptions.
</p>
<p>Yes - I agree with you completely as regards the role of a framework
as creating a standard &quot;format&quot; for interchange of self-contained
pieces of logic and presentation. However, I'm far from convinced
this should be done with the currency being a Java Object operating 
the semantics of something similar to a JSF (or other traditional) 
&quot;component&quot;. It's a common misunderstanding of RSF that it makes 
such a &quot;format&quot; impossible, but as I argue on the TSS thread, it would 
seem a superior solution for developers to swap &quot;components&quot; in the 
form of paired ViewProducers (and other finer-grained beans such as
Validators &amp;c) and markup fragments rather than heavy components - 
polymorphism through interface and aggregation rather 
than derivation is a more sound development practice, in terms of its
dependency impact.
</p>
<p>Anyone who I've spoken to who has worked with taglibs has been
outraged at how hard they are to work with. In terms of 
&quot;reinventing the wheel&quot;, many users tend to find that the wheels
invented by vendors are rarely quite the wheels they want to use,
and discover that trying to create their own is highly unrewarding.
I think most framework authors tend to grievously underestimate the
diversity of applications and requirements that their code will
encounter, and imagine that the scope for &quot;fully interchangeable
parts&quot; is far greater than, realistically, the industry is yet at
a position of supporting. It would be far less effort for the 
community if as a whole they could define and exchange software 
artefacts on a variety of different scales, rather than the single 
monolithic scale that the vendor has determined - we still face
the situation that there remains a lack of consensus in the 
industry as to what the equivalent of &quot;wheels&quot; actually are... or
even, whether they should actually go round.
</p>
<p>I think this sort of problem is symptomatic of what could be called
JSF &quot;meta-failings&quot; - while JSF always had the aim close to heart
to establish interoperability, its development practices actually
militate against this. As a different illustration, while many 
JSF core interfaces are in principle &quot;reimplementable&quot;, this is 
unlikely to be realised in practice by more than a single 
vendor/developer at the same time - since JSF interfaces are so 
large and stateful (FacesContext, ViewHandler &amp;c), it is unlikely 
that two different &quot;users&quot; of JSF would be able to arrange for 
their choice of semantics to be able to coincide within the same 
JSF &quot;installation&quot;.
</p>
<p>In your mention of AJAX I have to note that it's precisely in this
area I feel RSF more likely to benefit through &quot;interoperability&quot;.
Your point re reusability I think overlooks the point that Java
&quot;components&quot; of any kind are now, and probably will remain a minority
element of the webapp scene, which is increasingly full of bizarre
heaps of dynamic HTML libraries and self-contained and 
self-conceptualised client-side artefacts of many kinds. It's 
precisely through being &quot;behaviour-light&quot; I feel the RSF &quot;component&quot;
idiom is far more likely to lend itself to rapid integration with
emerging technologies, in addition to its &quot;plain-language&quot; bindings
system which renders server-side artefacts in a form readily 
interpretable and easy to manipulate on the client side.
