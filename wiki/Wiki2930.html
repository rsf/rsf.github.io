From this page you can download both source distributions (suitable for unzipping directly into your Eclipse workspace) and [WAR|http://access1.sun.com/techarticles/simple.WAR.html] files suitable for dropping into your Tomcat  webapps directory. Binary releases of the framework will be made available later on, as RSF gets closer to release.

RSF is currently declared to be at version 0.5 - have a look at the [Roadmap] page to get an idea of what features will be required to get to a 1.0 level.

!!Source distribution

Note that the names of the Eclipse projects (and of their corresponding directories) in these distributions do not exactly match the names in the SVN repository - in particular, RSFUtil corresponds to the directory J-RSFUtil and ServletUtil to J-ServletUtil. Since Eclipse projects are sorted in alphabetical order, I found this the only method to get projects to appear at a predetermined point in the list.

Note that all source is kept in CARET's public SVN server saffron, where all of this code may be found in the [projects|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/] directory.
