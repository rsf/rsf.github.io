As of RSF 0.7, all framework uses of RunnableWrapper were replaced by the slightly more streamlined [RunnableInvoker]
%%

RunnableWrapper is a really prime RSF [OLI], whose entire code looks as follows:

{{{
public interface RunnableWrapper {
  public Runnable wrapRunnable(Runnable towrap);
}
}}}

A RunnableWrapper is a &quot;machine&quot;, which takes in one unit of work (specified by a standard java.lang.Runnable), and spits out another one, wrapped in some extra logic.

This idea will be familiar to aficionados of [AOP], since it is really an equivalent (although a massively more &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; equivalent) of an AOP &quot;execute around&quot; advice. In [Chapter 6|http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/aop.html] of the Spring manual, you can see examples of Spring AOP in action, in particular the &quot;MethodInterceptor&quot; type. Since RSF lives in a request-scope IoC world, the need to express arbitrary &quot;kitchen-sink&quot; interception with support for arbitrary parameters is much lower - rather than pass these values into the wrapping bean as arguments, it is far cleaner for it to fetch them itself as request-scope dependencies.

Here is an example illustrating this point from the RSF [LogonTest] sample:

{{{
public class SecurityWrapper implements RunnableWrapper {
  private ViewParameters viewparams;
  private LogonBean logonbean;

  public void setViewParameters(ViewParameters viewparams) {
    this.viewparams = viewparams;
  }

  public void setLogonBean(LogonBean logonbean) {
    this.logonbean = logonbean;
  }

  public Runnable wrapRunnable(final Runnable towrap) {
    return new Runnable() {
      public void run() {
        if (logonbean.name == null
            &amp;&amp; !(LogonProducer.VIEW_ID.equals(viewparams.viewID))) {
          throw new SecurityException(&quot;Cannot view page &quot; + viewparams.viewID
              + &quot; while not logged on&quot;);
        }
        towrap.run();
      }
    };
  }
}
}}}

As we can see, all the inner context for the wrapper is injected in via the request-scope dependencies ViewParameters and LogonBean, and we can keep our clean &quot;nullary interface&quot; to the wrapper itself.

Ruby fans will also recognise the {{towrap.run();}} call as the equivalent of a zero-args {{yield}} call. What in Java requires a lot of reflective and AOP sweat (although in RSF, a bit less sweat), is simply part of the language in Ruby, with its powerful support for code-block arguments and &quot;continuation&quot; programming style.
