[EntityNameInferrer|http://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/site/apidocs/] is a core RSF interface which can be implemented by the framework user, to report to the framework the link between a particular entity class, and its &quot;name&quot;, which typically represents its [OTP] root. This interface is implemented &quot;for free&quot; when using the standard framework [EntityBeanLocator], and is useful for participating in the [IDDefunnellingReshaper] scheme.
