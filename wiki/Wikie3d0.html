<pre>
A not terribly catchy acronym for the &quot;Render Single Javascript Call in &lt;script&gt;&quot; (RSJCIS) strategy used in RSF to initialise autonomous markup segments on the client with Javascript event handlers etc. This is used in contrast to the more widespread technique based on manipulating {{body onload=&quot;&quot;}} handlers in view of its greater portability to other deployment environments such as JSR-168 portlets. Much more discussion on this issue is on the [BuildingRSFComponents] page.
