!!! RSF Trunk Code

The trunk code is the RSF code which is in development. If you need features which are not available in a release then this might be for you. If you are risk averse, then you probably want to go to the [current release page|CurrentCode].


!! Maven Repository
__NOTE:__ More details are available on the [current release page|CurrentCode]\\
__NOTE:__ The RSF trunk jar packages are available in [Maven2|Maven2Setup] only - however, milestone releases are generally still uploaded to both Maven 1 and Maven 2 repositories.\\
The trunk Java JAR files constituting the [RSF] framework may be found on the [CARET|http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/] [Maven2|Maven2Setup] dev repository ([http://www2.caret.cam.ac.uk/maven2dev/]). This location has been added to the [Maven2|Maven2Setup] pom.xml files of the trunk [sample apps|SampleRSFApps] and will cause the jars to be fetched automatically when the source is built.

!! Source [code distributions|CodeDistributions]
All RSF source code is available in [Subversion (SVN)|http://subversion.tigris.org/] on the [RSF SVN server|http://rsf.fluidproject.org/svn].\\
You can checkout the svn package once you download SVN by running __svn co &lt;SVN URL&gt;__, for example:
