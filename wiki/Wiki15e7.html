Before we discovered [Wicket], Tapestry was the framework &quot;out there&quot; that had the highest ratio of framework quality to community acceptance (on some naturally notional subjective scale :)

The idea to have pure HTML templating at all surely originated there, and from there was (indirectly) transmitted to RSF through JSF's [Hans Bergsten|http://www.hansbergsten.com/], whose article [&quot;Improve JSF by dumping JSPs&quot;|http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/06/09/jsf.html] and corresponding Chapter 15 in the [Java Server Faces book|http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jsvrfaces/] was the ultimate ancestor of what become RSF[1].

Many frameworks have followed where Tapestry led, but all (save Wicket) have fallen victim to the central problem of mixing presentation with logic - despite parsing (with varying degrees of fudges) as &quot;pure&quot;, these template files all contain references which resolve directly into the application's data model.

[#1] A Hans Bergsten memorial comment is preserved at the head of [ComponentProducer] where it ended up by an extremely circuitous route in the refactoring that led from the JSFUtil &quot;ClassViewHandler&quot; that evolved from Bergsten's ancestral implementation.
