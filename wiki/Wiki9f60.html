I am Antranig Basman, the designer and coder of RSF. I made this framework through being too embarrassed to take on another web project without it.

I like to talk in the first person on wiki pages a lot.

I am a consultant working for [CARET|http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk] on various projects, such as the FlowTalk discussion tool, Sakai integration tasks, amongst various internal projects.

Please send any comments/feedback on this site/technology to me at {{antranig (at) caret.cam.ac.uk.}}
