A [SubmittedValueEntry|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/RSFUtil/trunk/src/uk/org/ponder/rsf/request/SubmittedValueEntry.java] record is the unit of a cached request transaction - a primitive operation on the bean container required by a request, which is either the reading, writing, or &quot;unlinking&quot; of a bean value, or execution of a no-arg method. The pure data members (sans comments - see code link above for full details) are as follows:

{{{
public class SubmittedValueEntry {
  public String valuebinding;
  public String componentid;
  public Object oldvalue;
  public Object newvalue;
  public boolean isEL;
  public boolean isdeletion = false;
  public String reshaperbinding;
}
}}}

This structure is to be interpreted as a kind of &quot;union&quot; in which some entries are expected to be {{null}} where not relevant.

More details are in the section on the [RequestSubmittedValueCache].
