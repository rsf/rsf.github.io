A &quot;continuation&quot; is an object which contains a complete snapshot of a traditional stack-based operation in mid-flow, ready to be &quot;resumed&quot; at a later point. Continuations for a while have been relegated to the gloried ancestry of computing, but now that Java [bytecode manipulation|BCEL] is becoming a mainstream technology, they are starting to become fashionable once again. [RIFE Continuations|http://rifers.org/wiki/display/RIFE/Web+continuations], a package recently split off from its dependency on the rest of the RIFE web framework, looks like an excellent way for developers and clients to easily represent the flow of control during a [Multi-Request|MultiRequest] operation, since the clear procedural logic allows designers to ignore the disconnected GET-POST-GET sequence of the underlying HTTP operations.
