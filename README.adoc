This repository holds the pages for RSF documentation. We are engaged in an effort to regenerate the old JSPWiki pages with http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] so that they may be maintained with standard version control.

The build script assumes you have the prerequisites installed: asciidoc and git.

./generate-site.sh
----

The site pages will be created in the root directory from sources in `source`. Their layout is governed by `source/layout.conf`.

This system powers http://rsf.github.io
