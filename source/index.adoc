RSF -- Reasonable Server Faces
==============================

An archive of the RSF wiki is link:wiki/Wikib2ab.html[here.]

Our goal is to rebuild the RSF documentation in a source format which can be maintained and published via GitHub.
We're leaning toward http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] for the source format.

See http://github.com/rsf for source code and project activity.
