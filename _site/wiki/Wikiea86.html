A virtual fossil is a kind of [binding|Bindings] emitted by RSF into the output markup that represents a potential submission path which is initially disabled. The usage model is that client-side logic (e.g. Javascript) is able to easily detect and reenable these bindings to provide a richer/more dynamic interface where this functionality is supported. More details are on the main page on [Bindings].
