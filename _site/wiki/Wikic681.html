RunnableInvoker is a really prime RSF [OLI], whose entire code looks as follows:

{{{
public interface RunnableInvoker {
  public void invokeRunnable(Runnable torun);
}
}}}

RunnableInvoker abstracts the work of executing a work unit - an existing package of work is supplied as a standard JDK {{Runnable}} which is then invoked on the stack frame of the implementor, possibly surrounded by pre-, post-, or bracketing logic.

This idea will be familiar to aficionados of [AOP], since it is really an equivalent (although a massively more &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; equivalent) of an AOP &quot;execute around&quot; advice. In [Chapter 6|http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/aop.html] of the Spring manual, you can see examples of Spring AOP in action, in particular the &quot;MethodInterceptor&quot; type. Since RSF lives in a request-scope IoC world, the need to express arbitrary &quot;kitchen-sink&quot; interception with support for arbitrary parameters is much lower - rather than pass these values into the wrapping bean as arguments, it is far cleaner for it to fetch them itself as request-scope dependencies.

Here is an example illustrating this point from the RSF [LogonTest] sample:

{{{
public class SecurityWrapper implements RunnableInvoker {
  private ViewParameters viewparams;
  private LogonBean logonbean;

  public void setViewParameters(ViewParameters viewparams) {
    this.viewparams = viewparams;
  }

  public void setLogonBean(LogonBean logonbean) {
    this.logonbean = logonbean;
  }

  public void invokeRunnable(Runnable towrap) {
    if (logonbean.name == null
        &amp;&amp; !(LogonProducer.VIEW_ID.equals(viewparams.viewID))) {
      throw new SecurityException(&quot;Cannot view page &quot; + viewparams.viewID
          + &quot; while not logged on&quot;);
    }
    towrap.run();
  }
}
}}}

As we can see, all the inner context for the wrapper is injected in via the request-scope dependencies ViewParameters and LogonBean, and we can keep our clean &quot;nullary interface&quot; to the wrapper itself.

Ruby fans will also recognise the {{towrap.run();}} call as the equivalent of a zero-args {{yield}} call. What in Java requires a lot of reflective and AOP sweat (although in RSF, a bit less sweat), is simply part of the language in Ruby, with its powerful support for code-block arguments and &quot;continuation&quot; programming style.

RunnableInvoker replaced the slightly more verbose equivalent [RunnableWrapper] as of RSF 0.7.
