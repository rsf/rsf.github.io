[EntityBeanLocator](EBL) is a standard framework interface in RSF, that comes with a default implementation which makes writing an [OTP] space for an entity very easy, given just a standard &quot;DAO-type&quot; API managing the entity. This is a conventional application-scope API with methods such as &quot;findById&quot;, &quot;save&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, etc. and the EBL does the work of automatically setting up an [EL] address space for all the managed entities, and managing a request-scope cache so they can be addressed and manipulated quickly and clearly.

!!Using the framework default implementation

Assuming the API for the entity is sufficiently &quot;reasonable&quot;, this doesn't require writing any code, but simply a Spring definition. This definition is for an application scope bean extending the RSF framework parent {{entityBeanLocatorParent}}.

Here is the set of properties supported on this bean and their meaning:

|Property|Description
|{{fetchMethod}}|(Required) An EL path to a &quot;fetch method&quot; which can fetch entities by their ID - for example, a DAO API bean named {{BlogDao}} which had a method called {{findById}} which took a single argument, the Id, would be registered with a {{fetchMethod}} of {{BlogDao.findById}}
|{{newMethod}}|An EL path to a method which will be used to instantiate &quot;new&quot; (not yet persistent) examples of the entity. Either this property or {{entityClass}} must be set.
|{{entityClass}}|A Class object representing the class of the entity that this EBL deals in. If {{newMethod}} is not set, the EBL will instantiate new instances of the entity using the default constructor of this class.
|{{saveMethod}}|An EL path to a &quot;save method&quot; which will save modified entities back to some kind of persistence. This must take a single argument, which is the modified entity to be saved. If this property is not set, the {{saveAll}} method of the EBL will not function.
|{{removeMethod}}|An El path to a &quot;remove method&quot; which will remove an entity from persistence. This method must take one argument, which is the id of the entity to be removed.

!!A minimal example
For example, an (minimal)entry for a &quot;Blog&quot; entity might look like this:

{{{
&lt;bean id=&quot;Blog&quot; parent=&quot;entityBeanLocatorParent&quot;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;entityClass&quot; value=&quot;myPackage.Blog&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;fetchMethod&quot; value=&quot;myBlogDao.findById&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;saveMethod&quot; value=&quot;myBlogDao.save&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
}}}
!!What you get for your money

After having set up a definition of the sort just described, what you get done for you is the following:

* The full [OTP] pattern supported for your entity - that is, the ability to address in any request scope paths of the form {{Blog.15}} (representing the Blog entity with id 15) or even {{Blog.new 1}} representing a particular, transient Blog entity good for the current request
* If you supplied a {{saveMethod}}, you will get the ability to invoke a {{saveAll}} method on the resulting bean. Simply fetch the bean of the name you registered (only at ''request scope''), which will be an implementor of {{EntityBeanLocator}}, and invoke {{saveAll}} on it at request end.
* If you supplied a {{removeMethod}}, you will get the ability to invoke {{remove}} on the resulting bean, with an id argument - as well as the ability to target [deletion bindings|bindings] at the OTP root over the request.
* Finally, you will get for free to participate in the [EntityNameInferrer] scheme. This is particularly useful when making selection controls which are meant to select which instance of one entity type is attached to another via the [IDDefunnellingReshaper].
