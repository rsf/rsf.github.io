From this page you can download source distributions (suitable for unzipping directly into your Eclipse workspace) for RSF and its sample apps. The 3 JAR files constituting the framework (rsfutil-0.6.1.jar, 
j-servletutil-1.1.1.jar and ponderutilcore-1.1.1.jar) may be found on CARET's public [Maven repository|http://www2.caret.cam.ac.uk/maven/] at {{http://www2.caret.cam.ac.uk/maven/}} . This location has been added to the {{project.properties}} files of the sample projects and should cause the jars to be fetched automatically on build. However, you are ''warmly recommmended'' to make use of the source distributions, since RSF prides itself on being a framework that tries to avoid building barriers between user and framework code. Advanced uses of RSF in any case will depend on knowing your way round RSF's [4 Spring configuration files|SpringAPI].

The practice of providing &quot;ready-to-go&quot; WAR files in the previous [0.5 release|Downloads] of RSF has been abandoned, through public protest.

This release is of RSF version 0.6.1 - have a look at the [Roadmap] page to get an idea of what features will be required to get to a 1.0 level.

!!Source distribution - SVN Externals
As of RSF 0.6.1, a set of [SVN externals|http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html] have been provided to make it easy to check the complete set of tagged projects for a release out of SVN in one step. There are currently 4 source bundles that you may like to check out:

|[svn co https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-core/|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-core/] | The base source distribution for RSF, including RSFUtil, J-ServletUtil, PonderUtilCore and RSFHibernate
|[svn co https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-samples/|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-samples/] | The RSF example applications, including the simple &quot;Hello World&quot; app, the &quot;Number Guessing Game&quot;, and 3 versions of the &quot;Hibernate Cookbook&quot;.
|[svn co https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-sakai/|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-sakai/] | The [Sakai|http://www.sakaiproject.org/] integration library for RSF (SakaiRSF) together with Sakai-packaged builds for the Number Guessing and Cookbook samples. Just type &quot;maven sakai&quot;.
|[svn co https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-all/|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/bundles/rsf-all/] |All modules related to RSF, including all the above packages

NB the above links will appear empty in your browser, this is not an error! The externals will be correctly followed when you checkout either with svn command line or Subclipse in Eclipse.
%%
Note that the names of the Eclipse projects (and of their corresponding directories) in these distributions do not exactly match the names in the SVN repository - in particular, RSFUtil corresponds to the directory J-RSFUtil and ServletUtil to J-ServletUtil. Since Eclipse projects are sorted in alphabetical order, I found this the only method to get projects to appear at a predetermined point in the list.

Note that all source is kept in CARET's public SVN server {{saffron}}, where all of this code may be found in the [projects|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/] directory.

The &quot;downloadable zip&quot; method of source distribution last used in RSF 0.6 has been discontinued.
