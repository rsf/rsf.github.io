The {{viewID}}, a {{String}} field of the base [ViewParameters] object, identifies a [View], or rather a class of views. A view is a page with a common appearance and set of [component]s backing it - i.e. it is the {{viewID}} which is used as the primary key to look up the [ViewTemplate] and the [ComponentProducer]s for the current render (GET) cycle. The other (application defined) members of ViewParameters may define the view behaviour in more detail, but they cannot affect this initial lookup process (using the default implementations of ViewTemplateLoader &amp;c).
