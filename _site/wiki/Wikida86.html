The [IKAT|PureXHTMLTemplating] Template Checking Tool is an RSF application which can be used to verify that one set of RSF templates are &quot;equivalent&quot; to another in terms of their rendering power. This checks that the names and nesting structure of any {{rsf:id}} attributes have been preserved, for example in a roundtrip from developers to designers. This application may be checked out of SVN at [TemplateCheckingTool|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/RSFTemplateCheckingTool/trunk] and [TemplateChecker|https://saffron.caret.cam.ac.uk/svn/projects/RSFTemplateChecker/trunk], and also executed online at [Template Checking Tool|http://ponder.org.uk/TemplateCheckingTool/faces/check].
